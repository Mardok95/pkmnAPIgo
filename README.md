# pkmnAPIgo

I want to create a pokedex of first gen pokemon using Go. I started all the project with a tutorial of a simple GET request to an API server (Tutorial by TutorialEdge. Here: https://tutorialedge.net/golang/consuming-restful-api-with-go/)

Every folder contains a different version of the Pokedex project. v1 is the first one and so on.
